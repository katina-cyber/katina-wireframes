# Wireframe V2
## 2.16.2020
These wireframes are much more presentable. They took about 3-4 hours to create, and it shows compared to the V1 wireframes I made earlier. I wouldn't call them perfect, but they communicate the intended layout of my e-portfolio much better. 

Much of the design was inspired by of [Chuck Groom's One-Pager Website](https://www.chuckgroom.com/). I fell in love with the design, but I'm personally not the biggest fan of long, scrolling pages.
