These wireframes are much more presentable. They took about 3-4 hours to create, and it shows compared to the V1 wireframes I made earlier. I wouldn't call them perfect, but they communicate the intended layout of my e-portfolio much better. 

Much of the design was inspired by of [Chuck Groom's One-Pager Website](https://www.chuckgroom.com/). I fell in love with the design, but I'm personally not the biggest fan of long, scrolling pages. 

Additionally, the Pencil Project tool works nicely, and it is interesting that you can export your wireframes to a single HTML webpage.
