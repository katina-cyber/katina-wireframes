# EPortfolio Wireframe V1

## 2.16.2020
Honestly, not my proudest work, but I am uploading it here to show people what lazy work looks like. I think everyone is guilty of doing work with little effort. It is part of the learning process. You realize it's a lot more fun to put effort into the things you do, or at least be engaged with it. I did these "wireframes" initially to meet an assignment deadline, so they only took about 20 minutes. These wireframes are something I would consider rough, but not finished enough to proudly present to anybody. 

I used Libre Office Draw to create these, which I later found out is not the best for wireframing.
